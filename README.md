=== | **Elevator Pitch** | ===

While taking the Software Engineering Immersive Cohort through General Asssembly, I was unemployed so I could focus on the cohort. As a way to save money on my expenses, I would regularly eat Instant Ramen for lunch and/or dinner. But after a week or so, the base flavor of the noodles got boring and mildly unappealing. So as a way of keeping my meals interesting and enjoyable I would add different spices, vegetables, and/or proteins. This really made the Instant Noodles much more enjoyable for me, considering how often I was eating them. So I created Noods, an app for others to share their favorite recipes for Instant Noodles with each other and explore and discover how others like to enjoy their noodles!
